# phase1-group-project

Pitch/Read-me: Group6 (Ignacio, James, Yax) 

Our application theme is a cocktail generator based on user input. 

Initial title name will be “Click & Drink”.

Our core features will be to fetch a cocktail API, have the user select an emoji based on their taste. This emoji will be linked to a certain spirit.

Once the spirit has been chosen, the application will display all the cocktails of the emoji/spirit chosen. From there, they will choose a cocktail from the list, which will consequently display drink info/ingredients, etc.

Our project will include fetching data from API, use Array methods to access our particular drink recommendations based on user input, and add event listeners to track control the experience. 

The API we will be using is: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php 

Sincerely, 
Ignacio, James, Yax
